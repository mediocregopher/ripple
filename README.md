# ripple

Avoiding them just makes more.

A little 2D lua game written inside of an 18-hour period. Made with
[LÃ–VE][love].

The more times you jump, the more points you get. The more times you jump, the
more ripples you make. And you can't touch the ripples.

## Build

First download and install [love][love], then simply:
